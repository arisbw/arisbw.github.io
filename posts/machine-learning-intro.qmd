# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is transforming the way we solve problems. Let's explore the basics!

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning
   - Classification
   - Regression

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality Reduction

3. Reinforcement Learning

## Getting Started

To begin your machine learning journey, you'll need:

- Python programming skills
- Understanding of basic statistics
- Knowledge of key libraries like scikit-learn
- Passion for data and problem-solving
